# Libft
This is the first project at 42. The goal is to re-create various standard C library functions along with other useful functions that will help out a lot with further projects. The idea behind Libft is to keep adding to it while going through 42. This project could have been structured better but we had to follow a strict "norm" at 42 for grading purposes.
